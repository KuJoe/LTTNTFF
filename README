Disclaimer: This is my first attempt at a Chrome/Edge extension and I put all of 5 minutes into the actual extension, it's very basic though so it shouldn't break anything but if it does I am not responsible for any loss or damages. Check the source code yourself to be safe and only download this from GitHub, I will never upload this anywhere else on the internet.

NOTE: This extensions is not provided by LTT or AMD, I just like using the Night Theme 2.0 on the LTT forums and I needed an icon for the extension and happened to have an AMD logo from 2008 sitting on this PC so I used it for laughs.
